#This chapter introduces three python editors (IDEs), namely, IDLE, Spyder (can be downloaded in clone arcgispro-py3 environment), and PyCharm. 
#To check the environment used within IDLE (there are two underscores before and after file):
import numpy
print(numpy.__file__)
#This code prints the location where numpy package reside: C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\lib\site-packages\numpy\__init__.py
#The Get Count tool is used to determine the number of rows for a feature class
count=arcpy.management.GetCount("parks")
print(count)
